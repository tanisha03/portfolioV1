The human attention span has been reduced to 8 seconds. Things that don't seem to make a mark within these 8 seconds are often skipped and ignored. Maybe, that is the reason Tinder and Bumble seemed to rule the speed dating market with instant swipes. This 'Tinderization' or swipe as a strategy has a large potential for the apps to come wherein every business is in a neck-to-neck competition to attract user's attention.


Dating online now is not just restricted to looks and fancy bio, it has taken shape in the mutual taste of humour/memes like <a href="https://www.schmoozedating.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schmooze</a>. Schmooze users can swipe right on the memes they relate to or find funny, and the app will connect people with compatible tastes. Hence, no need to wait for pickup lines to form an impression and let the memes do the talking.


However, swiping has more market opportunities and has found its way into retail and e-commerce. Online shopping can be transformed with the adoption of tinderization helping users make faster choices like the one adopted by <a href="https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Net-a-Porter app</a>. Swiping yes or no for a product, can bring customer closer to the brick and mortar setting without cluttering with shipping information and other details.  


<i>Online dating and online shopping have a lot in common. The options are nearly endless, and itâ€™s tough to find the good ones.</i>



The potential of such a UX is huge, primarily because of two reasons. Firstly, it's quick, convenient and to an extent quite addictive because of the gamification of the experience. This leads to more data based on the swipes and in turn contributes to the second reason i.e. availability of organic binary data for a better recommendation.


Another domain where swiping can expand its reach in the music and audio industry. An article on Quartz mentions how <a href="https://qz.com/quartzy/1724523/dating-apps-like-tinder-are-using-music-on-spotify-to-forge-connections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connections can be forged by similar music tastes</a>. The reverse can be materialized in the form of collaborative playlists in music streaming platforms to help listeners discover better when 10 seconds snippets of the most played sections of songs are swiped right or left by the user.

Collaboration has the power to increase user retention much greater than individual indulgence. It would be great to see such features out in the market where the winner would be the one who impresses in the least possible time.
