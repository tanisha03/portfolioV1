I was reading an interesting [article](https://potential.app/ios-15-humane) encompassing digital wellbeing and how iOS settings can potentially help us free from the latches of persuasive design or addiction based businesses. If such digital wellbeing settings are implemented on an OS level, it might disrupt the AdTech market.

But then if you think about it we often many of us break our own rules and revoke the restrictions even though we actually want to restrict it. It has got to to our habitual practice of mindless scrolling that we can't get over and so we go back to it rather than doing something fruitful.

But, the bottom line is I agree people think digital wellbeing is all fancy and sounds cool but super hard to follow because the incentive here is saved time but is that a real incentive for you? If not, you can never stick to such restrictions and plans.

In that case how would you icentivize to follow such restrictions ?
