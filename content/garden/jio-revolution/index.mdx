There was a hubbub after a WhatsApp popup stating the change in privacy policy this year but the timeline has been much older. After its acquisition in 2014, FB has been on the lookout to extract data from the 2.5 billion user base. In 2016, WhatsApp started sharing metadata with FB to better track metrics.

Let's look at the other end of the spectrum, an example from our very own country, Reliance Jio. After the launch of Jio in 2015, internet penetration drastically increased with Jio having a 53 percent market share currently. This was only possible because it had the means to invest over $22.5 billion. As a result, access to the internet in rural areas has tripled since 2015 and is growing at a rate of 35% a year.

Now, the thing to think about is how will the FB & Jio partnership change the usage of internet and WhatsApp. Around the time of the change in the privacy policy, it was announced that Jio is planning to embed its JioMart platform into Facebookâ€™s WhatsApp. This was followed by the announcement of the most affordable phone by Jio to be released with Google at the Reliance AGM. If we connect the dots, it's a win-win situation for everyone. Jio intends to increase the internet penetration with smartphone and FB eyeing on leveraging the reach to generate revenue from the platform with the largest user base.
