Netflix rules the internet space with just one product out in the market which provides the content to 139 million paid subscribers. <i>Around 80% of stream time is achieved through Netflix’s recommender system, which is a highly impressive number. Netflix’s personalized recommendation algorithms produce $1 billion a year in value from customer retention</i>


we often find ourselves scrolling through such OTT platforms endlessly in search of something to watch. If you think about it, with over 7K TV shows and movies, it is difficult to find an ideal match without a recommender system.


Only because <i>"First impressions last"</i>, Netflix plays its cards the moment your eyes fall on a recommended show. The thumbnails/artworks are personalized to convince you to press the play button. These are based on what the other viewers with a similar fondness and preferences have clicked on. The set of images are hence annotated and ranked in a similar manner.


Another tactic, Netflix plays to keep us hooked is cataloging the show displays. The Netflix home screen is a grid layout where shows are grouped into rows. Each row is a curated collection of recommendations based on your previous history. Going down rows, or going left in a particular row decreases the likelihood of watching any particular show based on the recommendations.


Well, data is the new strength and with every actions of ours being recorded on such platforms, the recommendation tends to become even more accurate. This in turn results in higher conversion rate and levelled up revenue. And that is how Netflix will keep us binging on it.
