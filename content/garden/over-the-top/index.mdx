Netflix is entering into ecommerce space. Why ?

When netflix started, it experienced huge competition from the video rental stores called Blockbuster. However, Blockbuster didn't have a subscription and it earned huge revenues from the late fee incurred. Netflix hence started a subscription based model without any late last fee and soon gained traction. Following Netflix, blockbuster also started online subscription stores but could not last long.

Another competitor here was Walmart using the Leader pricing policy i.e. it started selling DVDs for cheaper to attract customers and indulge them in buying more, hence overall profitability.

However it's again facing the same competition in 2021 from other OTT platforms likes of Disney, HBO who earn a lot from theatre releases and are pulling out their content from Netflix and feature on their platforms. Also, Amazon is using the same Leader pricing through the Prime membership to attract customers to buy more products.

Hence, it becomes very crucial for Netflix to expand it's reach and not solely depend on subscription fees.
